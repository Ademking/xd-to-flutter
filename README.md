![Plugin-Example](https://media.giphy.com/media/l4XVdfY3yWBJJ7euck/giphy.gif)

## About this Project

The idea of the Plugin is:

_"Increase productivity and decrease time spent with front-end code"._

## Why?

This project was designed to accelerate my company's software development and to help everyone wasting time with simple and repetitive widgets creation processes.\
I will be happy if you can help me with as many PR's as you like so that we can perfect the plugin more and more

- [ ] Gradient
- [ ] Text Area
- [ ] Line (Just straight line at the moment)

- Generate partial screen layout

<--## Installers
If you want to use the Plugin in Production mode, just browse the xd plugins and install it.

### Installing

**Cloning the Repository**

```
$ git clone https://github.com/thize/xd-to-flutter
```

Paste the Folder on Xd Develop Folder.\
To get to that folder, simply go to this menu item: Plugins > Development > Show Develop Folder.

### Running

You just need to let XD know that it should load your plugin again. This is done with the Plugins > Development > Reload Plugins menu item. Thereâ€™s a corresponding keyboard shortcut (Cmd + Shift + R on macOS and Ctrl + Shift + R on Windows) for even faster reloading.

## Contributing

You can send how many PR's do you want, I'll be glad to analyse and accept them! And if you have any question about the project...
